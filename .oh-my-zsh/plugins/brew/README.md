# brew plugin

The plugin adds several aliases for common [brew](https://brew.sh) commands.

To use it, add `brew` to the plugins array of your zshrc file:

```zsh
plugins=(... brew)
```

## Shellenv

If `brew` is not found in the PATH, this plugin will attempt to find it in common
locations, and execute `brew shellenv` to set the environment appropriately.
This plugin will also export `HOMEBREW_PREFIX="$(brew --prefix)"` if not previously
defined for convenience.

## Aliases

## Completion

With the release of Homebrew 1.0, they decided to bundle the zsh completion as part of the
brew installation, so we no longer ship it with the brew plugin; now it only has brew
aliases. If you find that brew completion no longer works, make sure you have your Homebrew
installation fully up to date.
